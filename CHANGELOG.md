### Working Commands
```bash
devkit status                    # System health and component status
devkit generate "prompt"         # AI-powered code generation
devkit analyze ./path            # Codebase analysis and symbol extraction
devkit shell install            # Install shell integration
devkit shell status              # Check shell integration status
devkit shell completions bash   # Generate completion scripts
```
