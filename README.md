- Unified notification panel for agent interactions
- Context-aware agent coordination

### 🔍 Intelligent Code Generation
- Advanced code generation flow detection
- Context-aware prompting using codebase analysis
- Support for large, existing codebases

### 🧠 Natural Language Processing
- Automatic detection between natural language prompts and commands
- Natural language to code translation
- Debugging assistance through conversational interface

### 🔗 Rich Context Integration
- Codebase context analysis using tree-sitter
- Image and URL context support
- Documentation integration and indexing
- Git repository awareness

### 🖥️ Cross-Shell Compatibility
- Support for zsh, bash, fish, and PowerShell
- Native shell integration and command execution

### ⚡ Performance & Customization
- Built with Rust for maximum performance
- Fully customizable appearance and behavior
- Configurable prompts and settings
- Custom keybindings support

### 📱 User Interface
- Intuitive block-based input/output grouping
- Advanced cursor navigation
- Customizable keybindings
- Real-time agent status monitoring

## Architecture

The project is structured with the following core modules:

- **Agent System**: Multi-agent coordination and management
- **Code Generation**: Advanced code analysis and generation
- **Context Management**: Codebase indexing and context extraction
- **Shell Integration**: Cross-platform shell compatibility
- **UI Components**: Terminal-based user interface
- **Configuration**: User preferences and settings management
