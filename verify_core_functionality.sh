echo "- ✅ Application compiles and basic help works"  
echo "- ✅ Interactive mode can start and shutdown cleanly"

echo "Next steps:"
echo "1. Run: ./target/release/devkit interactive"
echo "2. Follow the tests in manual_test_guide.md"
echo "3. Verify persistent input mode works as expected"

echo "Key things to verify manually:"
echo "- Status bar shows persistent mode messages"
echo "- Input/command modes stay active until ESC"
echo "- All commands work correctly"
echo "- No crashes or hangs"
